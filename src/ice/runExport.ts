/**
 * Export through the ICE engine (#2120): what the engine does between an
 * export source and the file a user downloads.
 *
 * The rules, each from docs/planning/ice-planing.md:
 *
 * - export starts from the thing being exported (operator, 2026-10-28). Its
 *   source says what kind of items it yields; the formats offered are the
 *   `out` shims that make a file and can be reached from that kind, through
 *   other `out` shims (D9), and nothing else ({@link exportChains});
 * - the source's owner checks its existing read permission (D5) before
 *   anything is read; the engine has no export permission of its own;
 * - shims chain: each one's output is the next one's input, matched by kind;
 *   the last makes `file`s: one is the download as it is, several (or a
 *   source that asks for it) are packed into one zip. A `file` the source
 *   already made, such as an attachment's original, skips the chain;
 * - every limit is configuration: the chain's length, and the bytes any step
 *   may hold ({@link runExportChain}).
 *
 * This file writes nothing anywhere: the caller holds the file it returns.
